# GameAI Exercise 02: Flocking
## About
The following repository was created to host class exercise 02 from Game AI lesson in CITM UPC university.

The main objective of this exercise was to implement an AI algorithm called **Flocking**. To do so, we used Unity game engine in its **2021.3.14f1 version** and some free assets from the Unity Assets Store and then we implemented the algorithm using C# Unity scripts.
